# Bias Detector

![alt text](https://github.com/marinamer/Political-Bias-NLP/blob/main/Screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

This is my final project for the Data Analytics Bootcamp @ Ironhack. The aim of this project was to train a Machine Learning Model so that it can detect if a text is ideologically
biased and if it's a right wing or a left wing bias if that's the case. 

To run it locally you'll need:
- Python
- pickle (Python module)
- nltk (Python module)

The models are saved in the Flask folder. Just open the file app.py, execute it and open the address that will appear in the console where your code was executed
/BiasDetector in your browser.

The model is highly imrpovable and I intend to work on it further, so this project is just my first try at Natural Language Processing. 

## Test Texts
To see all the possible outomes you can try these test texts:

 * They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
  -Donald Trump

 * The emancipation of woman will only be possible when woman can take part in production on a large, social scale, and domestic work no longer claims anything but an insignificant amount of her time.
  -Friedrich Engels, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State

 * The mobile phone was invented in 1973
  -Fact
